It was also too slow.,No,The app has a connected status.,No as I found it too slow to respond. It would be ok to monitor the time spent in close proximity,If it was improved it could be useful,a clippable badge would be easier to fix and would be easier to keep facing in the right direction,Vibration as I feel you'd need to be constantly looking at the device rather than what you should be looking for.,The app funcitons need to be larger to accomodate bigger digits.,The device needs to be shaped to keep it's position better.,Yes,5,5,None,5,NONE,5,None,Days of the week,Number of interactions,daily count of interactions,Number of interactions ,It might be useful to know the time of interactions,duration of the interactions in minutes,distance for the interactions,the number of interactions was updated,4,,date,inteactions on the date,The number of interactions are excessive,2,
