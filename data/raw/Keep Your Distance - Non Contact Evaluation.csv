It might be better if it only alerted you after a threshold time limit had been reached to block out those very fleeting interactions - say someone lingers within your 2m for more than __ seconds, or comes within 1.5m (?) when they should be at 2m. That way, when someone passes by quickly at 1.75m you would not be alerted, but if someone comes closer or lingers too long it would let you know.

There should also be provision made for people who have sensitivity to lights or flashing. Maybe having the alerts come from your phone instead so individuals can decide how to be alerted and perhaps even have less disruptive settings for indoor compared to outdoor?
