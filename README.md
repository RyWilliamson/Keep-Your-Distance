# Guidance

This is a suggested template for a project. You can modify it as you please, but
but remember to keep:

- a timelog, updated regularly in the `timelog.md` format;
- all source under version control;
- data well organised and with appropriate ethical approval (for human subject data);

Here's an overview of the structure as it stands:

- `timelog.md` The time log for your project.
- `plan.md` A skeleton week-by-week plan for the project.
- `data/` data you acquire during the project
- `src/` source code for your project
- `status_report/` the status report submitted in December
- `meetings/` Records of the meetings you have during the project.
- `dissertation/` source and for your project dissertation
- `presentation/` your presentation

# Build Process

I used Windows 10 throughout development.

## Prerequisites

1. Install LaTeX I used [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) on Windows 10 or on Ubuntu: `apt-get install texlive-full`

## Dissertation (Windows 10 / Linux)

Navigate to the dissertation directory within the project, inside a terminal, and use the command: `pdflatex l4proj.tex`
