It was a significant issue to prevent and control COVID-19 on both national and global scales due to the dramatic increase in confirmed cases worldwide. Government guidelines provide a fundamental resource for communities, as they guide citizens on how to protect themselves against COVID-19, however, they also provide critical guidance for policy makers and healthcare professionals on how to take action to decrease the spread of COVID-19. We aimed to identify the differences and similarities between six different countries’ (US, China, South Korea, UK, Brazil and Haiti) government-provided community and healthcare system guidelines, and to explore the relationship between guideline issue dates and the prevalence/incidence of COVID-19 cases.},

  abstract  = {The wearables’ market is rapidly evolving, with applications ranging from healthcare and activity monitoring to emerging domains such as drones and haptic helmets. Wearable-based contact tracing is gaining increased attention in the COVID-19 era for more efficient disease prevention. Therefore, it is of timely relevance to identify the leading existing wireless contact-tracing solutions and their suitability for wearables. Existing trade-offs of contact-tracing applications require a thorough analysis of technical capabilities, such as accuracy, energy consumption, availability, sources of errors when dealing with wireless channels, privacy challenges, and deterrents towards a large-scale adoption on the wearables market. Based on extensive literature research, we conclude that decentralized architectures generally offer a better place in a trade-off in terms of accuracy and user eagerness to adopt them, taking into account privacy considerations, compared to centralized approaches. Our paper provides a brief technical overview of the existing solutions deployed for contact tracing, defines main principles that affect the overall efficacy of digital contact tracing, and presents a discussion on the potential effect of wearables in tackling the spread of a highly contagious virus.},

  abstract   = {Detecting and controlling the diffusion of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 is crucial to managing epidemics. One common measure taken to contain or reduce diffusion is to detect infected individuals and trace their prior contacts so as to then selectively isolate any individuals likely to have been infected. These prior contacts can be traced using mobile devices such as smartphones or smartwatches, which can continuously collect the location and contacts of their owners by using their embedded localisation and communications technologies, such as GPS, Cellular networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of these technologies and determines the impact of contact tracing precision on the spread and control of infectious diseases. To this end, we have created an epidemic model that we used to evaluate the efficiency and cost (number of people quarantined) of the measures to be taken, depending on the smartphone contact tracing technologies used. Our results show that in order to be effective for the COVID-19 disease, the contact tracing technology must be precise, contacts must be traced quickly, and a significant percentage of the population must use the smartphone contact tracing application. These strict requirements make smartphone-based contact tracing rather ineffective at containing the spread of the infection during the first outbreak of the virus. However, considering a second wave, where a portion of the population will have gained immunity, or in combination with some other more lenient measures, smartphone-based contact tracing could be extremely useful.},

Observations of average horizontal position error only seemed to improve with time of day (afternoon) during the leaf-off season.

Overall average horizontal position accuracy of the iPhone 6 (7–13 m) is consistent with the general accuracy levels observed of recreation-grade GPS receivers in potential high multi-path environments.},

COVID-19 is known to be a highly infectious virus, and infected individuals do not initially exhibit symptoms, while some remain asymptomatic. Thus, a non-negligible fraction of the population can, at any given time, be a hidden source of transmissions. In response, many governments have shown great interest in smartphone contact tracing apps that help automate the difficult task of tracing all recent contacts of newly identified infected individuals. However, tracing apps have generated much discussion around their key attributes, including system architecture, data management, privacy, security, proximity estimation, and attack vulnerability. In this article, we provide the first comprehensive review of these much-discussed tracing app attributes. We also present an overview of many proposed tracing app examples, some of which have been deployed countrywide, and discuss the concerns users have reported regarding their usage. We close by outlining potential research directions for next-generation app design, which would facilitate improved tracing and security performance, as well as wide adoption by the population at large.},

This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 μs, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.},

With various novel protocol stack features, BLE is finding use on resource-constrained sensor nodes as well as more powerful gateway devices. Particularly proximity detection using BLE beacons has been a popular usage scenario ever since the release of Bluetooth 4.0, primarily due to the beacons’ energy efficiency and ease of deployment. However, with the rapid rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), BLE is likely to be a significant component in many other applications with widely varying performance and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements and there is a need for a consolidated view of the role that BLE will play in applications beyond beaconing. This paper comprehensively surveys state-of-the-art applications built with BLE, obstacles to adoption of BLE in new application areas, and current solutions from academia and industry that further expand the capabilities of BLE.},

We also present the most popular techniques used to prioritize the software project requirements and a compression between these techniques. On the other hand, we spot the light on the importance of involving the non-functional requirements prioritization because of the great effects of non-functional on project success and quality; some approaches that used in prioritize non-functional requirements are discussed in this paper, in addition a general model is proposed based on reviewing the prioritization techniques in order to suggests a best suited technique for specific projects according to decision makers parameters.},

In this research, the GNSS precise point positioning (PPP) accuracy of the Xiaomi mi 8 smartphone is tested in post-processing and real-time modes. Raw dual-frequency observations are collected over two different time windows from both of the Xiaomi mi 8 smartphone and a Trimble R9 geodetic-quality GNSS receiver using a short baseline, due to the lack of a nearby reference station to the observation site. The data sets are first processed in differential modes using Trimble business center (TBC) software in order to provide the reference positioning solution for both of the geodetic receiver and the smartphone. An in-house PPP software is then used to process the collected data in both of post-processing and real-time modes. Precise ephemeris obtained from the multi-GNSS experiment (MGEX) is used for post-processing PPP, while the new NAVCAST real-time GNSS service, Germany, is used for real-time PPP. Additionally, the real-time PPP solution is assessed in both of static and kinematic modes. It is shown that the dual-frequency GNSS smartphone is capable of achieving decimeter-level positioning accuracy, in both of post-processing and real-time PPP modes, respectively. Meter-level positioning accuracy is achieved in the kinematic mode.},

  abstract   = {In the wake of recent COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing has turned out to be an indispensable technique to help administrative authorities contain localized infections efficiently. In the absence of a definitive and an official vaccine for the infection, practicing social distancing has proved to be an effective norm to prevent the risk of infection. In this paper, we present 'ProxiTrak', a smartphone based solution for an enterprise scenario capable of not only tracing the chain of possible infection transmission among a set of population, but also guiding the users towards following social distancing norms by alerting them in real-time about any possible violation of proximity norms on their smartphones. We devise an effective classification model to make proximity decisions on the smartphone itself using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data of on-board Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module using multiple mobile devices in different environments, with novel addition of using temporal features from BLE data to boost the model's accuracy. We briefly discuss ProxiTrak's corresponding server-side framework for tracing a possible chain of infection and analysing social connectivities graphically. We also propose on-device decision aggregation and server-side pruning of proximity events to lower the false positive events. Our model is capable of making strong proximity decisions to an accuracy of up to 94\% on the devices trained with the model.},
